# Deployment Success Report
## October 28, 2025 - ISV Solution Deployment

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed the first production-ready deployment of the Adaptable Custom Grid PCF control using proper ISV solution structure. The control is now deployed to the DEV environment and ready for client distribution.

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Pre-Deployment Cleanup ✅
- **Identified old solutions:** AdaptableDec2024, AdaptableOct, AdaptableTEMP
- **Removed control from forms:** All form references removed manually
- **Deleted temporary solutions:** Cleaned up via Power Platform admin center
- **Verified cleanup:** Confirmed no old solutions remain with `pac solution list`

### 2. Build Process ✅
**PCF Control Build:**
```bash
npm run build
```
- Status: ✅ Completed successfully
- Build timestamp: 2025-10-28 05:27:03
- Warnings: Expected ESLint warnings (set to warn, not error)

**Solution Package Build:**
```bash
cd AdaptableSolution && dotnet build
```
- Status: ✅ Completed successfully
- Output: `AdaptableSolution/bin/Debug/AdaptableSolution.zip`
- Package size: 424 KB

### 3. Deployment ✅
**Command Used:**
```bash
pac solution import --path "AdaptableSolution/bin/Debug/AdaptableSolution.zip" --async
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Deployment successful in ~47 seconds
- ✅ Solution visible in environment: "Adaptable Custom Grid" (v1.0)
- ✅ Control namespace: `Adaptable.GridChangeTracker`
- ✅ Publisher: Adaptable (prefix: adapt)
- ⚠️ Solution Checker detected violations (non-blocking)

### 4. Testing ✅
- ✅ Control added to forms successfully
- ✅ All core functionality tested and working:
  - Grid display
  - Inline editing
  - Change tracking
  - Save operations
  - Aggregations
  - Column operations
- ✅ Control displays as `Adaptable.GridChangeTracker` (not OpalAdaptable)

## Solution Checker Findings

**Status:** ⚠️ Violations detected (non-blocking for functionality)

**Report URL:** https://d365-salesandcustomerservice-dev.crm6.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.1/msdyn_analysisjobs(10b678f3-beb3-f011-bbd3-7ced8d3490a8)/msdyn_analysisjobsreport/$value

**Expected Issues:**
- TypeScript `any` type usage (ESLint warnings already visible)
- Code quality recommendations
- Best practice suggestions

**Action Required:**
- Review detailed Solution Checker report in Power Platform
- Address critical violations before PROD deployment
- Non-critical issues can be addressed post-deployment

---

## Commands Reference

### For Future Deployments

**Build and Deploy:**
```bash
# 1. Build PCF control
npm run build

# 2. Build solution package
cd AdaptableSolution
dotnet build
cd ..

# 3. Authenticate (if needed)
pac auth create --environment [YOUR_ENV_URL]

# 4. Deploy solution
pac solution import --path "AdaptableSolution/bin/Debug/AdaptableSolution.zip" --async

# 5. Verify deployment
pac solution list | grep -i "adaptable"
```

**Quick Rebuild and Redeploy:**
```bash
npm run build && cd AdaptableSolution && dotnet build && cd .. && pac solution import --path "AdaptableSolution/bin/Debug/AdaptableSolution.zip" --async
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (1-2 hours)
1. **Review Solution Checker violations**
   - Access report via Power Platform admin center
   - Identify critical vs. warning issues
   - Plan remediation for critical issues

2. **Update control version to 1.0.0**
   - Edit `GridChangeTracker/ControlManifest.Input.xml` line 3
   - Change version from 0.0.3 to 1.0.0
   - Rebuild and redeploy

### Short-term (1 week)
1. **Deploy to TEST/PP environment**
   - Use same deployment process
   - Validate all functionality
   - User acceptance testing

2. **Create user documentation**
   - Feature guide
   - Configuration reference
   - Troubleshooting tips

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
1. **Deploy to PROD environment**
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Deploy managed solution
   - Monitor post-deployment

2. **Implement testing framework**
   - Unit tests for core functions
   - Integration tests
   - Minimum 60% coverage

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Proper solution structure** - ISV solution architecture prevents future conflicts
2. **Manual cleanup** - Portal-based deletion was faster than CLI for bulk removal
3. **Async deployment** - Using `--async` flag provided better visibility into deployment progress
4. **Documentation** - Having removal guide streamlined the cleanup process

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Solution Checker integration** - Should run checker before deployment as separate step
2. **Version management** - Should update version before first production deployment
3. **Testing automation** - Need automated tests to catch regressions early
4. **Preview image** - Control lacks visual preview in form editor

### Recommendations for Future Deployments
1. Always use `pac solution import` with proper solution structure
2. Never use `pac pcf push` for production deployments
3. Run Solution Checker as separate validation step before import
4. Maintain deployment documentation for each environment
5. Use version numbering that reflects deployment stage (1.0.0 for PROD)

## Support Information

### Troubleshooting

**Control doesn't appear in form editor:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Verify solution is imported: Solutions → AdaptableSolution

**Old control still showing:**
- Ensure old solutions were deleted
- Check form isn't referencing old namespace
- Republish the form

**Functionality not working:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify control properties are configured
- Ensure dataset is bound correctly
