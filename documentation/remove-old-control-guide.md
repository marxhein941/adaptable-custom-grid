# Guide: Removing Old PCF Control from Development Environment

## Why Remove?
The control was previously deployed with:
- Namespace: `OpalAdaptable` (should be `Adaptable`)
- Publisher: `PowerAppsToolsPublisher_opal` (should be `Adaptable`)
- Method: `pac pcf push` (creates temporary solution)

The new deployment uses proper ISV solution structure that's incompatible with the old deployment.

---

## Step 1: Identify the Old Control Solution

### Method A: Using PAC CLI
```bash
# Authenticate to your dev environment
pac auth create --environment [YOUR_DEV_ENV_URL]

# List all solutions to find the temporary one
pac solution list

# Look for solution names like:
# - PowerAppsToolsTemp_opal
# - PowerAppsToolsTemp_opalcrm
# - Or any solution with the old publisher
```

### Method B: Using Power Platform Admin Center
1. Navigate to https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com
2. Select **Environments** ‚Üí Your Dev Environment
3. Click **Solutions**
4. Look for solutions containing "PowerAppsToolsTemp" or "OpalAdaptable"

---

## Step 2: Check Control Usage

**IMPORTANT:** Before removing, check if any forms are using the control!

### Using PAC CLI:
```bash
# Check dependencies of the solution
pac solution check --solution-name "PowerAppsToolsTemp_opal"
```

### Using Power Platform:
1. Go to https://make.powerapps.com
2. Select your Dev environment
3. Go to **Solutions** ‚Üí Find the temp solution
4. Click **...** ‚Üí **See solution layers**
5. Check if any forms reference the control

### Manual Check:
1. Open any forms where you added the control
2. Note which forms use it
3. You'll need to re-add the new control to these forms after deployment

---

## Step 3: Remove Control from Forms

If the control is being used, you must remove it first:

1. Open the form editor for each form using the control
2. Select the control on the form
3. Click **Delete** or **Remove**
4. Click **Save** ‚Üí **Publish**
5. Repeat for all forms

**Tip:** Take screenshots of the control's configuration (properties) before removing so you can reconfigure the new control identically.

---

## Step 4: Delete the Old Solution

### Method A: Using PAC CLI (Fastest)
```bash
# Delete the temporary solution
pac solution delete --solution-name "PowerAppsToolsTemp_opal"

# If you get an error about dependencies, you may need to delete other related temp solutions
pac solution delete --solution-name "PowerAppsToolsTemp_opalcrm"
```

### Method B: Using Power Platform Admin Center
1. Go to https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com
2. Select **Environments** ‚Üí Your Dev Environment
3. Click **Solutions**
4. Find the temporary solution (e.g., "PowerAppsToolsTemp_opal")
5. Click **...** ‚Üí **Delete**
6. Confirm deletion

### Method C: Using make.powerapps.com
1. Go to https://make.powerapps.com
2. Select your Dev environment
3. Go to **Solutions**
4. Find the temporary solution
5. Select it and click **Delete**
6. Confirm deletion

---

## Step 5: Clean Up Multiple Temp Solutions

You may have multiple temporary solutions from testing. Check for:
- `PowerAppsToolsTemp_opal`
- `PowerAppsToolsTemp_opalcrm`
- `PowerAppsToolsTemp_dev`
- `PowerAppsToolsTemp_adapt` (from early testing)
- `PowerAppsToolsTemp_ada`
- `PowerAppsToolsTemp_adp`
- etc.

**Script to list all temp solutions:**
```bash
# List all solutions and filter for temp ones
pac solution list | findstr "PowerAppsToolsTemp"
```

Delete each one using:
```bash
pac solution delete --solution-name "[SOLUTION_NAME]"
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Cleanup

```bash
# Verify temp solutions are gone
pac solution list | findstr "PowerAppsToolsTemp"

# Should return nothing

# Verify old publisher is gone (optional)
# The old publisher may remain but won't be used
pac admin list-publishers
```

---

## Step 7: Deploy New Solution

Now you can deploy the new AdaptableSolution:

```bash
# Build the solution first
cd AdaptableSolution
dotnet build

# Navigate back
cd ..

# Authenticate if needed
pac auth create --environment [YOUR_DEV_ENV_URL]

# Import the new solution
pac solution import --path "AdaptableSolution\bin\Debug\AdaptableSolution.zip"
```

---

## Step 8: Re-add Control to Forms

1. Open the form editor for each form that used the old control
2. Add a new control
3. Search for "Adaptable" or "GridChangeTracker"
4. The control should now show as `Adaptable.GridChangeTracker`
5. Configure the control properties (use your screenshots from Step 3)
6. Save and Publish

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Solution cannot be deleted because it has dependencies"
**Cause:** Forms or other components still reference the control

**Fix:**
1. Go back to Step 3 and ensure all forms have the control removed
2. Check for any other components (views, dashboards) using the control
3. Try again

### Error: "Solution not found"
**Cause:** Solution name may be different

**Fix:**
```bash
# List all solutions to find the exact name
pac solution list

# Look for the one with your control
```

### The new control doesn't appear after import
**Cause:** Solution import may still be processing

**Fix:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes
2. Refresh the browser
3. Check Solutions ‚Üí AdaptableSolution ‚Üí Components
4. Verify GridChangeTracker is listed

### Forms still show old control after deletion
**Cause:** Browser cache

**Fix:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Close and reopen the form editor

---

## Alternative: Keep Both (Not Recommended)

You could technically keep both controls, but this is **not recommended** because:
- ‚ùå Confusing to have two controls with similar names
- ‚ùå Forms won't automatically upgrade
- ‚ùå Publisher inconsistency
- ‚ùå Future updates will only apply to new control
- ‚ùå Twice the maintenance burden

If you must keep both temporarily:
1. Deploy new solution without deleting old
2. Both will appear in control selector
3. Gradually migrate forms from old to new
4. Delete old solution once all forms migrated

---

## Best Practice Workflow

**For DEV environment:**
1. Remove old control (this guide)
2. Deploy new solution
3. Test thoroughly

**For TEST/PROD environments:**
- If you never deployed the old control ‚Üí Just deploy new solution
- If you deployed old control ‚Üí Follow this removal guide first

**Going forward:**
- Always use `pac solution import` with AdaptableSolution
- Never use `pac pcf push` for this control anymore
- The proper solution structure is now in place
